Title: Shopping Notification App Using Receipts

Background: Graduate students and working professionals often have busy schedules, making it difficult to find time for shopping. Consequently, when essentials such as detergent, fabric softener, or groceries run out, they have to make frequent shopping trips, which can be a waste of time. Therefore, I want to develop an app that can automatically predict shortages of household items and groceries, even without the user keeping track of their stock levels, and suggest a consolidated shopping list to minimize the number of shopping trips.
